1
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:38,667
My memories awaken within this blue forest

2
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:45,106
The beast in my chest, sneering in the darkness

3
00:00:45,106 --> 00:00:52,474
In the contest of wills, one in white who stays by my side

4
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:58,817
Bring forth the light, satisfy my thirst

5
00:00:58,817 --> 00:01:06,393
Reflected in these eyes is the heat of a distant summer day

6
00:01:06,393 --> 00:01:13,141
Shaded in the sky is the blood over the moonlight

7
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:21,177
Transcending the far reaches of time is my love for your soul

8
00:01:21,177 --> 00:01:28,578
I'll never let go of this night

9
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:36,026
In the dead of night, the heat haze from distant days

10
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:42,609
Surfaces weakly in the crimson moonlight

11
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:49,993
The one in white, who silently falls down

12
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:56,449
Bring forth the light, satisfy my thirst

13
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:03,785
As if sweetly melting, the faint scent of blood draws me in

14
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:10,672
announcing the demise of my peaceful daily life

15
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:18,265
In the awoken memories, something has emerged far in the distance

16
00:02:18,265 --> 00:02:25,056
In the moments which are passed down...

17
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:50,969
In the contest of wills, one in white who stays by my side

18
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:59,270
Bring forth the light, satisfy my thirst

19
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:06,491
Reflected in these eyes is the heat of a distant summer day

20
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:13,573
Shaded in the sky is the blood over the moonlight

21
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:21,433
Transcending the far reaches of time is my love for your soul

22
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:28,237
I'll never let go of this night
